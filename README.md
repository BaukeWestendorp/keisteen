# Keisteen
*Keisteen is an experimental Minecraft Server implementation written in Rust.*

![Server List](README/serverlist.png)

**Why?**
a) Why not?
b) For fun!

There are lots of Minecraft Server implementations written in Rust to be found, and I do not intend to challenge them. This project is mostly a side-project that started out of curiosity, so do not expect it to work, be fast or, God forbid, be stable.
